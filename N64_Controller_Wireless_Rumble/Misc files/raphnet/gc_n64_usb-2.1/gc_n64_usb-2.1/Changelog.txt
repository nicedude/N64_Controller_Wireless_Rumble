--- v2.1 (November 12, 2011)
    - Fixed USB detection when no controllers are present. This was broken
	  in 2.0. Controller swapping still worked fine though.

	- Changed the device name to allow easier version identification.

--- v2.0 (November 3, 2011)
    - Force feedback support:
	  - N64 rumble pack and Gamecube controller built-in vibration supported!
	  - Implemented using standard HID PID (Physical Interface Device) which 
	    means: No special driver required. Tested on Linux (fftest) and win7
       directx.
	  - Special thanks to Sean Green for providing an updated device
	    descriptor and an example main.c from his own project for me
		to use and finally implement this feature. Without this, I don't
		think I would have ever taken the time to add this feature.	

	- The L and R buttons analog feature on gamecube controllers can be
	  disabled. Useful when they are causing problems and you don't mind
	  using only the L and R digital switches. To disable the analog feature, 
	  fully press  L and R when connecting the controller.

	- The calibration fixer windows executables are now provided with
	  the source code. See calibration_fixer/readme.txt for details.
 
	- Code cleanups:
	  - New asm transmission code capable of sending many bytes with perfect
	    timing.
      - N64/Gamecube communication code is now shared between the N64 and 
		GC drivers. It's the same wire protocol so it makes sense.

--- v1.4 (June 2011)
    - Update gamecube reception code using the new N64 algorithm from 1.3.
	  To my knowledge, this does not fix a known problem but being more robust
	  should be good.

	- Synchronized controller polling with USB polling. This should prevent USB
	  communications from interferring with the timing sensitive N64/Gamecube 
	  protocol. At least with my equipment, this seems to fix very rare spurious
	  button presses (One in several minutes).

	- Confirmed the adapter works with the new white gamecube controllers with
	  extra long cable (Japanese import).

--- v1.3 (May 2011)
	- Found out why some HORI pads where having issues (random joystick jumps and
	spurious button presses). This is due to the HORI communication timing
	being very different from original Nintento pads. (1.5 times slower bit
	rate). Implemented a new reception algorithm that should be very tolerant
	to timing variations and jitter. Works well with all my controllers.
	
	- It is now possible hot-swap between N64 and Gamecube controllers.
	With earlier versions, this would have required a disconnect/reconnect
	of the USB cable to reset the firmware.

	- It is no longer necessary to connect a controller (gc or N64) in
	order for the adapter to be detected by the computer (USB).

	- Updated USB code to vusb-20100715 from
	http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html

--- v1.2 (Nov ??, 2008)
	Nintendo Wavebird controllers are now supported.
	Compatibility improvements.

--- v1.1 (Nov 11, 2007)
	C-Stick vertical orientation was wrong.

--- v1.0 (Apr 21, 2007)
Initial release:
	Nintendo 64 controller support
	Gamecube controller support
