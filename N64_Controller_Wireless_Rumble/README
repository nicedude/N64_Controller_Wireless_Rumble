Welcome!

The goal of this project is to construct a Nintendo64 and Gamecube compatible device,
which will enable us to connect a controller to either console or to a PC via USB.

We rely heavily on the work already done by raph at http://raphnet.net
and by Jakob Schaefer, who has posted a video (with a link to a pdf) here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlnmfaILCHw

furthermore, we want to add a wireless option, so that we won't need cables from the controllers.

We want to be able to use the wireless option with a normal console, i.e. without the USB connection.

We want to be able to switch between all modes without modifying the completed hardware.

Planned modes of operation:

1. use a wired N64 controller to pc (like raphnet's design)
2. use a wireless N64 controller for pc. (A combination of raphnet's and Jakob Schaefer's designs)
3. use a wireless N64 controller for the console. (Jakob Schaefer's design)
4, 5, 6 same as the above, but for Gamecube controllers.

(7) perhaps add the possibility to use gamecube controllers on a N64.


Priotiry of stages of implementation:

pretty much in the order mentioned above.

We want all of this to be implemented in an open source manner, meanning that everyone should be able to copy this design.

Expect updates on/after tuesdays .. this is a collaboration taking place at our local hackerspace osaa.dk where we meet on tuesdays..
